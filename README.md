For the application to function, it requires an api key. You can request a key from https://www.themoviedb.org/.

This application uses the youtube api for playing trailers.  To use it you must get an api key.  The following link contains instructions on how to get an api key.  https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started

After you get the keys, create a file called gradle.properties in the PopularMoviesStage1 folder.  In that file, add the following following strings TheMovieDB_ApiKey="YourKeyGoesHere" and Youtube_ApiKey="YourKeyGoesHere".

Also, the youtube app is required for video playback in the app.
